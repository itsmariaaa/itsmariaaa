### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Maria

Iâ€™m a political science student interested in political/sociological behaviour, electoral processes and public policy evaluation. That is why I have a high interest in data analysis, in order to be able to apply it to political science.

I'm learning to program in R and other data visualization tools. Later on, I will want to learn Python.
