## Hi there👋 
### 🙋🏻‍♀️ It's Maria

I’m a political science student interested in political/sociological behaviour, electoral processes and public policy evaluation. That is why I have a high interest in data analysis, in order to be able to apply it to political science.

I'm learning to program in R and some data visualization tools, like PowerBi. I'm also starting to learn SQL with MySQL. Later, I want to learn Python.

### 🛠️ Tools
* Language: R, SQL
* Database: MySQL
* Visualization: PowerBI
